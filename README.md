# Gallium's bitmap font generator
**Generate an accurate TTF or OTF font by vectorizing Minecraft resource pack files.**

## Program Usage
When you launch the program, youâ€™ll see a selection menu where you can choose which step to run.  
Each step requires the output of the previous one, and you will be notified if a step cannot be executed due to missing files.  
The first step requires an internet connection to download assets; the other two only need a connection to install dependencies.  
If you enter step 0, all steps will be executed in order.
